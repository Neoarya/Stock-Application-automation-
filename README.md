# Stock-Application-automation-

I have made a project on #automation and #webscraping .    

Here are some points on my project :    

1.) The idea behind my project is that when we invest in stock market we generally depend only on stock brokers/agents or people's review on that stock.     

2.) I have tried to create a Stock App that can create a MARKET REPORT PDF providing some useful content about a particular stock like nifty details, stock details, news about that stock, community sentiments about that stock. etc    

3.) All Nifty 50 stock details can be scrapped by just changing index in the code.    

4.) Also, in parallel the script is posting stock details on Facebook with some recommendations.    

5.) My project aims to provide extra information about a stock to generate maximum gain in stock market.   




Here stocks.js is my main file and other stuffs are created after running the script. So just for reference I have also uploaded that extra stuffs.
